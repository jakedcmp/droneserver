# MAVLink MCP - Project Status & Roadmap

## 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY UPDATE (v1.2.3)

**⛔ `pause_mission()` HAS BEEN DEPRECATED DUE TO CRASH RISK ⛔**

During flight testing, `pause_mission()` caused a **drone crash** by descending from 25m to ground impact. The tool entered LOITER mode, which **does NOT hold current altitude** in ArduPilot.

**✅ SAFE ALTERNATIVE:** Use `hold_mission_position()` which stays in GUIDED mode.

**See:** [LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md](LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md) for full details.

## 🛡️ Active Flight Management System

**This MCP server is NOT just a MAVLink command pass-through!**

Traditional drone APIs simply forward commands to the flight controller. This MCP server actively manages the flight to prevent common AI mistakes:

### Why Active Management Matters

| Problem | Without Active Management | With MAVLink MCP |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| LLM sends `go_to_location` then immediately `land` | Drone lands before reaching destination | **Landing Gate BLOCKS** - "Cannot land, 1.2km from destination!" |
| LLM sends `go_to_location` before takeoff completes | Drone flies horizontally at low altitude | **Takeoff waits** for altitude before returning |
| LLM forgets to check arrival status | User doesn't know flight progress | **monitor_flight** guides LLM with "CALL AGAIN" instructions |
| LLM stops monitoring mid-flight | Mission abandoned, drone left hovering | **action_required** field keeps LLM engaged until landed |

### Safety Features (v1.3.1)

#### Landing Gate
- `land()` checks if drone is at the registered destination
- If >20m away, landing is **BLOCKED** with helpful error
- Use `land(force=True)` only for emergencies

#### Takeoff Altitude Wait
- `takeoff()` waits until target altitude is reached before returning
- Prevents navigation commands while still climbing

#### Destination Tracking
- `go_to_location()` registers the target in `pending_destination`
- Other tools know where you're heading and can verify arrival

#### Chunked Flight Monitoring
- `monitor_flight()` provides 5-second progress updates
- Each response includes `DISPLAY_TO_USER` string to show the user
- Each response includes `action_required` telling LLM what to do next
- Tracks full lifecycle: in_progress → arrived → landing → landed
- Returns `mission_complete: true` only when safely on ground

### Recommended Prompt

```
Arm the drone, takeoff to 50 meters, and fly to [DESTINATION].

After go_to_location, you MUST call monitor_flight() repeatedly in a loop.
Show me DISPLAY_TO_USER after each call.
DO NOT STOP until mission_complete is true - the drone needs monitoring!
```

**Why "repeatedly in a loop" is critical:**
- ChatGPT batches tool calls and stops after showing one result
- Without explicit "loop" instruction, it abandons the drone mid-flight
- Landing is automatic, but only if you keep calling `monitor_flight()`

Set `auto_land=False` if you want to hover at destination instead of landing.

### Example Flight Monitoring Output (DISPLAY_TO_USER)

```
🚁 FLYING | Dist: 2500m | Alt: 50.0m | Speed: 10.5m/s | ETA: 3m 58s | 0%
🚁 FLYING | Dist: 1500m | Alt: 50.0m | Speed: 10.8m/s | ETA: 2m 19s | 40%
🚁 FLYING | Dist: 500m | Alt: 50.0m | Speed: 10.1m/s | ETA: 49s | 80%
✅ ARRIVED! | Distance: 8.2m | Alt: 50.0m | Flight time: 248s
🛬 LANDING | Alt: 25.0m | Descending...
🛬 LANDING | Alt: 10.0m | Descending...
✅ MISSION COMPLETE - Drone has landed safely!
```

## 🔧 Recent Changes

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.4: 🎨 Logging & Code Cleanup ✅
**Improved:** JSON logging, transparency, and code quality
- **JSON I/O Logging:** All tool calls now log input/output as formatted JSON for easy debugging
- **Transparency:** `set_yaw` now clearly explains why it uses lat/lon coordinates (MAVSDK workaround)
- **Better Colors:** Darker, more readable colors in terminal logs
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed orbit functionality (unreliable with ArduPilot)
- **Mission Prep:** Switched to `mission_raw` API for future ArduPilot mission support
- **Tool Count:** 36 → 35 (orbit removed, missions moved to future development)

**Benefits:**
- Easier debugging with JSON input/output visibility
- Clearer logs with better color contrast and AGL/MSL altitude labels
- More focused feature set (removed confusing orbit feature)
- Foundation for reliable mission support in future release

---

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.3: 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY FIX 🔴
**DEPRECATED `pause_mission()` - Causes drone crashes!**
- **Issue:** Flight testing revealed `pause_mission()` causes altitude descent → ground impact
- **Root Cause:** LOITER mode does NOT hold current altitude in ArduPilot
- **Crash Details:** Descended from 25m → 5m → ground impact in 8 seconds
- **Fix:** `pause_mission()` now returns error and refuses to execute
- **Safe Alternative:** Use `hold_mission_position()` which stays in GUIDED mode
- **Documentation:** Added LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md with full analysis
- **Impact:** Prevents future crashes - update immediately if using `pause_mission()`

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.2: Mission Control Improvements ✅
**Added:** `hold_mission_position` tool and enhanced mission diagnostics
- **New Tool:** `hold_mission_position` - Alternative to `pause_mission` that stays in GUIDED mode (avoids LOITER)
- **Improved:** `resume_mission` now shows current waypoint, flight mode, and mode transition status
- **Improved:** `is_mission_finished` now includes waypoint progress, flight mode, and completion percentage
- **Benefit:** Better mission pause/resume control without unwanted flight mode changes
- **Use Case:** Pause mission for inspection without altitude drift from LOITER mode

### November 17, 2025 - Fixed `hold_position` Altitude Descent ✅
**Fixed:** `hold_position` now stays in GUIDED mode instead of switching to LOITER
- **Problem:** Drone was descending when `hold_position` was called due to mode switch
- **Root Cause:** `drone.action.hold()` switched from GUIDED → LOITER, causing altitude reference mismatch
- **Solution:** Now uses `goto_location(current_position)` to hold without mode change
- **Result:** Stable altitude maintenance, no unexpected descents during complex flight sequences

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.1 Patch: Error Handling & Compatibility ✅
**Improved:** Based on comprehensive testing (67% success rate → better error messages)
- Enhanced mission upload validation with clear format error messages
- Battery monitoring fallback for uncalibrated systems (voltage-based estimates)
- Firmware compatibility matrix added to documentation

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.0 Development: Advanced Navigation & Mission Enhancements ✅
**Added:** 6 new tools for advanced flight control

**Advanced Navigation (2 tools):**
- `set_yaw` - Rotate drone to face specific direction (with cardinal directions)
- `reposition` - Move to location and loiter

**Mission Enhancements (4 tools):**
- `upload_mission` - Upload mission without auto-starting
- `download_mission` - Retrieve mission from drone
- `set_current_waypoint` - Jump to specific waypoint index
- `is_mission_finished` - Check if mission completed

**Status:** v1.2.0 nearly complete! 35 tools total (+10 from v1.1.0)

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.0 Development: Parameter Management ✅
**Added:** 3 new parameter management tools
- `get_parameter` - Read any drone parameter with auto-type detection
- `set_parameter` - Write parameters with safety warnings
- `list_parameters` - List all parameters with optional filtering

### November 16, 2025 - Documentation Cleanup
- Removed historical development notes
- Consolidated roadmap into STATUS.md
- Streamlined documentation structure
- **Files removed:** 4 redundant MD files

### November 12, 2025 - v1.1.0 Major Update

- Critical safety tools (disarm, RTL, battery, hold, kill)
- System health checks
- GPS quality monitoring
- Speed and attitude telemetry
- Mission pause/resume/clear
- Absolute GPS navigation

**Impact:** Complete, safe drone operations from arm to disarm!

### November 12, 2025 - ArduPilot GUIDED Mode Fix
**Issue:** Previous implementation tried to use PX4 OFFBOARD mode on ArduPilot  
**Fix:** Updated to use ArduPilot-native GUIDED mode via `goto_location()` API

### November 2, 2025 - Relative Movement Bug Fix
**Issue:** `move_to_relative` not moving drone horizontally  
**Fix:** Added proper GPS coordinate calculation with latitude compensation
