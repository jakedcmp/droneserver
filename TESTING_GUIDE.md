## 🎯 Comprehensive Test Scenario - Tower Inspection Mission

This test exercises **all 35 tools** including the 10 new v1.2.0 features.

### Copy this prompt into ChatGPT:

```
I need to conduct a detailed inspection of a cell tower. Here's what I need you to do:

PHASE 1 - PRE-FLIGHT CONFIGURATION:
1. First, show me all the RTL (Return to Launch) parameters currently configured
2. Check what the current RTL altitude is set to
3. If RTL altitude is less than 30 meters, set it to 30 meters for safety
4. Show me the battery capacity parameter and tell me what it's set to
5. Run a complete health check to make sure we're ready to fly

PHASE 2 - MISSION PREPARATION:
6. I want to create a 4-waypoint inspection mission around the tower. Upload (but don't start yet) a mission with these waypoints:
   - Waypoint 1: Approach point at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m
   - Waypoint 2: North side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427, altitude 30m  
   - Waypoint 3: East side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, altitude 40m
   - Waypoint 4: Return to approach at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m

7. Download the mission back from the drone to verify it uploaded correctly

PHASE 3 - FLIGHT OPERATIONS:
8. Arm the drone and take off to 15 meters
9. Check our current position and battery level
10. Fly to the first waypoint position (lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427) and hold there at 20m
11. Rotate the drone to face due east (90 degrees) so the camera is pointing at the tower
12. Now orbit around the tower base at a 25 meter radius, moving at 3 m/s, centered on lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427 at 25m altitude, going clockwise
13. After 30 seconds of orbiting, tell me what our current speed is
14. Check the battery level again - if it's below 70%, I want you to warn me

PHASE 4 - DETAILED INSPECTION:
15. Stop the orbit and reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426 at 40m altitude to get a closer view of the upper tower section
16. Face north (0 degrees) to align with the tower
17. Get our current attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) to confirm we're level and facing the right direction

PHASE 5 - MISSION EXECUTION:
18. Now start the 4-waypoint mission we uploaded earlier
19. Monitor the mission and tell me when we reach waypoint 2
20. At waypoint 2, pause the mission temporarily
21. Check if the mission is finished (it shouldn't be since we paused it)
22. Resume the mission and let it continue
23. Keep checking until the mission is finished

PHASE 6 - RETURN AND LANDING:
24. Once mission is complete, check battery one more time
25. If battery is above 40%, orbit one more time around lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427 at 30m radius at 15m altitude, counter-clockwise at 2 m/s
26. Return to launch position
27. Land the drone
28. Disarm when safely on the ground

PHASE 7 - POST-FLIGHT:
29. Download the mission from the drone one more time to save it
30. Show me all parameters that changed during the flight (compare with initial values)

Please execute this entire inspection mission step by step, confirming each action before moving to the next. Warn me immediately if any step fails or if battery gets critically low.

## 🔬 Intelligent Granular Test (Complete Coverage with Verification)

This test systematically validates **all 35 tools** with **intelligent prerequisites** and **ACK/NACK verification**. Each test confirms the drone actually performed the action, not just that the API call succeeded.

### Copy this prompt into ChatGPT:

```
I need you to test every single MCP tool with INTELLIGENT VERIFICATION. For each test:
1. Check PREREQUISITES before executing
2. Execute the command
3. Wait appropriate time
4. VERIFY the drone actually did what was requested
5. Report ACK (verified success) or NACK (failed to verify)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Never apply yaw/movement commands unless drone is in the air (altitude > 2m)
- Before disarming, MUST verify altitude < 0.5m AND drone is landed
- After each movement, verify position/altitude/attitude changed as expected

### What This Tests

**Intelligent Verification (Not Just API Calls):**
- ✅ **Prerequisites checked** before each command (e.g., must be in air for yaw)
- ✅ **ACK/NACK logic** - Verifies drone actually performed action, not just API success
- ✅ **Telemetry confirmation** after every movement (position, altitude, attitude, speed)
- ✅ **Value comparison** - Saves initial state and verifies changes
- ✅ **Tolerance-based verification** - Realistic ±2m altitude, ±15° heading tolerances
- ✅ **Multi-step verification** - Example: set_yaw → wait → get_attitude → verify heading changed

**Complete Tool Coverage:**
- ✅ **Telemetry (7 tools)**: health, battery, GPS, position, speed, attitude, flight mode
- ✅ **Parameters (3 tools)**: list, get, set + verification of persistence
- ✅ **Flight Control (10 tools)**: arm, takeoff, move, hold, land, disarm, RTL
- ✅ **Navigation (3 tools)**: set_yaw, reposition, orbit (with movement verification)
- ✅ **Missions (11 tests)**: upload, download, start, pause, resume, progress, jump, clear
- ✅ **Safety (4 checks)**: RTL, battery, pre-disarm altitude+speed, prerequisite gates

**Smart Safety Features:**
- ✅ **Prerequisite gates**: Yaw/movement commands ONLY if altitude > 2m
- ✅ **Triple safety check before disarm**: altitude < 0.5m + speed < 0.5 m/s + not falling
- ✅ **ABORT on unsafe conditions**: Will NOT disarm if any safety check fails
- ✅ **State tracking**: Saves HOME position, initial battery, initial yaw for verification
- ✅ **Distance calculations**: Verifies drone actually moved expected distance

**Enhanced Reporting:**
- ✅ **ACK** = Tool worked AND drone did what was requested (verified)
- ✅ **NACK** = Tool call succeeded but drone didn't act as expected (failed verification)
- ✅ **SKIPPED** = Prerequisite not met (e.g., can't test yaw if drone not in air)
- ✅ Detailed failure analysis showing expected vs actual values
- ✅ Identifies API success vs action failure (critical distinction)

## 🚀 Quick Test (5 Minutes)

For a faster feature test:

```
Quick inspection test:

1. Show me all battery parameters
2. Get the RTL altitude parameter - if it's less than 20m, set it to 20m
3. Run a health check
4. Arm and takeoff to 10 meters
5. Face north (0 degrees) to orient the camera
6. Orbit around lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427 at 15 meter radius, 2 m/s, clockwise, at 15m altitude

## 🧪 Individual Feature Tests

### Parameter Management Tests

**Test 1: Read Parameters**
```
Show me all parameters that start with "RTL"
Then show me all parameters that start with "BATT"
What is the current RTL_ALT value?
```

**Test 2: Modify Parameters**
```
Get the current RTL altitude
Set it to 2500 (25 meters)
Read it back to confirm the change
```

**Test 3: Parameter Discovery**
```
List all parameters (show me the count first)
Then show me just the GPS-related parameters
Show me the first 10 parameters alphabetically
```

---

### Advanced Navigation Tests

**Test 4: Orbit Mode**
```
Arm the drone and takeoff to 20 meters
Check our GPS position
Orbit around our current location at 30 meter radius, 3 m/s, clockwise
After 30 seconds, stop and hold position
Check our speed to confirm we stopped
Land and disarm
```

**Test 5: Heading Control**
```
Arm and takeoff to 15 meters
Face north (0 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face east (90 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face south (180 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face west (270 degrees)
Get our current attitude to confirm heading
Land and disarm
```

**Test 6: Reposition**
```

Check current position
Reposition to 50 meters north of current position at 20m altitude
Check new position to confirm
Hold there for 30 seconds
Return to launch and land
Disarm
```

---

### Mission Enhancement Tests

**Test 7: Mission Upload/Download**
```
I want to upload a 3-waypoint mission. Here are the waypoints in the correct format:

Waypoint 1: {"latitude_deg": 33.6459, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 15}
Waypoint 2: {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 15}
Waypoint 3: {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8428, "relative_altitude_m": 15}

Upload this mission using the upload_mission tool (don't start it yet)
Then download the mission back using download_mission
Show me the downloaded waypoints to verify they match
```

**Note:** Make sure to specify the exact field names (`latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`, `relative_altitude_m`) as shown above. The v1.2.1 update provides better error messages if the format is wrong.

**Test 8: Mission Control**
```
Assuming a mission is uploaded:
1. Check if the mission is finished (should be false - not started)
2. Arm, takeoff to 10m, and start the mission
3. Wait until waypoint 1 is reached
4. Pause the mission
5. Check if mission is finished (should be false - paused)
6. Jump to waypoint 3 using set_current_waypoint
7. Resume the mission
8. Monitor until mission is finished
9. Return to launch and disarm
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Success Indicators
✅ ChatGPT sequences actions logically  
✅ All 35 tools are called appropriately  
✅ Parameters read/write correctly  
✅ Orbit executes smoothly  
✅ Yaw control shows cardinal directions  
✅ Mission upload/download cycle completes  
✅ Battery monitoring triggers warnings  
✅ Mission status checks work correctly  

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: GPS coordinates drift**
- Solution: Use relative coordinates from current position
- Or: Adjust lat/lon for your test location

**Issue: Orbit not working - "Command not supported by autopilot"**
- **Root Cause:** Orbit command requires ArduPilot 4.0+ or PX4 1.13+
- **Workaround:** Server provides waypoint-based circle pattern instructions
- **Alternative:** Use repeated `go_to_location` + `set_yaw` for manual orbit
- **Note:** The error message will suggest how many waypoints to use for the requested radius

**Issue: Parameter names not found**
- Solution: Parameter names vary (ArduPilot vs PX4)
- Try: List all parameters first to find correct names
- **Examples:**
  - ArduPilot: `RTL_ALT`, `BATT_CAPACITY`, `WP_SPEED`
  - PX4: `RTL_RETURN_ALT`, `BAT_CAPACITY`, `MIS_SPEED`

**Issue: Mission upload format errors - "Missing required fields"**
- **Root Cause:** Each waypoint must be a dictionary with exact field names
- **Correct Format:**
```python
waypoints = [
  {"latitude_deg": 33.6459, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 15},
  {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 20}
]
```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Using `lat`/`lon` instead of `latitude_deg`/`longitude_deg`
  - Using `altitude` instead of `relative_altitude_m`
  - Passing string coordinates instead of numbers
- **v1.2.1 Improvement:** Error messages now show exactly what was received vs expected

**Issue: Mission download returns empty or fails**
- **Root Cause:** Some autopilots don't support mission download or require specific firmware
- **Workaround:** Keep a local copy of uploaded missions
- **Check:** ArduPilot: works on 4.0+; PX4: works on 1.12+

**Issue: Battery showing 0% throughout flight**
- **Root Cause:** Battery monitoring not calibrated or not supported by simulator
- **v1.2.1 Fix:** Server now detects this and provides voltage-based estimates
- **Look For:** `estimated_percent` field in battery response
- **Solution:** Set `BATT_CAPACITY` parameter to your battery's mAh rating
- **Simulator Note:** SITL often doesn't simulate battery drain accurately

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Expected execution times:
- **Quick Test:** ~5 minutes
- **Full Tower Inspection:** ~15-20 minutes
- **Individual Feature Tests:** ~2-3 minutes each

## 🔧 Customizing Tests

### Adjust GPS Coordinates
Replace these coordinates with your location:
```python
# Example coordinates (Irvine, CA)
BASE_LAT = 33.6459
BASE_LON = -117.8427

# Calculate offsets for waypoints
# ~0.0001° latitude ≈ 11 meters
# ~0.0001° longitude ≈ 9 meters (at 33° latitude)
```

### Modify Mission Patterns
Common patterns:
- **Square:** 4 waypoints in square formation
- **Circle:** Use orbit instead of waypoints
- **Grid:** Multiple parallel lines for surveys
- **Vertical:** Same lat/lon, different altitudes

---

## 🚨 Safety Notes

⚠️ **ALWAYS:**
- Test in open area away from people/buildings
- Maintain visual line of sight
- Have RC transmitter ready for manual override
- Monitor battery levels closely
- Start with low altitudes (5-10m)

⚠️ **NEVER:**
- Test near airports or restricted airspace
- Fly in bad weather (wind, rain, fog)
- Test with low battery
- Leave drone unattended
- Ignore safety warnings
