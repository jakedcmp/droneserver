# Comprehensive Test - Tower Inspection Mission

Complete system validation through a realistic inspection scenario.

## Overview

- **Duration:** 15-20 minutes
- **Tools Tested:** 35 out of 36
- **Phases:** 7
- **Total Operations:** 30
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Best For:** Full system validation in realistic workflow

## Test Scenario

This test simulates a detailed cell tower inspection mission, exercising **all 36 tools** including the 10 new v1.2.0 features and the enhanced v1.2.2/v1.2.3 mission control improvements.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE

**ALTITUDE REFERENCE:** All altitude commands in this test use **relative altitude** (height above home/ground), NOT absolute MSL altitude. Commands like `reposition`, `go_to_location`, and `takeoff` automatically handle the conversion.

**Never command underground altitudes!** Always ensure relative altitudes are positive values.

```
I need to conduct a detailed inspection of a cell tower. Here's what I need you to do:

PHASE 1 - PRE-FLIGHT CONFIGURATION:
1. First, show me all the RTL (Return to Launch) parameters currently configured
2. Check what the current RTL altitude is set to
3. If RTL altitude is less than 30 meters, set it to 30 meters for safety
4. Show me the battery capacity parameter and tell me what it's set to
5. Run a complete health check to make sure we're ready to fly

PHASE 2 - MISSION PREPARATION:
6. I want to create a 4-waypoint inspection mission around the tower. Upload (but don't start yet) a mission with these waypoints:
   - Waypoint 1: Approach point at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m
   - Waypoint 2: North side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427, altitude 30m  
   - Waypoint 3: East side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, altitude 40m
   - Waypoint 4: Return to approach at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m

7. Download the mission back from the drone to verify it uploaded correctly

PHASE 3 - FLIGHT OPERATIONS:
8. Arm the drone and take off to 15 meters
9. Check our current position and battery level
10. Fly to the first waypoint position (lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427) and hold there at 20m
11. Rotate the drone to face due east (90 degrees) so the camera is pointing at the tower
12. Fly to lat 33.6459, lon -117.8425 (west side of tower) staying at your current altitude
13. Rotate to face the tower (face east at 90 degrees) and hold position for 10 seconds
14. Now fly to lat 33.6461, lon -117.8427 (east side of tower), staying at same altitude
15. Rotate to face west (270 degrees) toward the tower and hold for 10 seconds
16. Tell me what our current speed is
17. Check the battery level again - if it's below 70%, I want you to warn me

PHASE 4 - DETAILED INSPECTION:
19. Reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, climb to 40m relative altitude to get a closer view of the upper tower section
20. Face north (0 degrees) to align with the tower
21. Get our current attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) to confirm we're level and facing the right direction

PHASE 5 - MISSION EXECUTION:
22. Now start the 4-waypoint mission we uploaded earlier
23. Monitor the mission and tell me when we reach waypoint 2
24. At waypoint 2, use hold_mission_position to pause safely (do NOT use pause_mission - it's deprecated)
25. Check if the mission is finished (it shouldn't be since we paused it)
26. Resume the mission and let it continue
27. Keep checking until the mission is finished

PHASE 6 - RETURN AND LANDING:
28. Once mission is complete, check battery one more time
29. Return to launch position
30. Land the drone
31. Disarm when safely on the ground

PHASE 7 - POST-FLIGHT:
32. Download the mission from the drone one more time to save it
33. Show me all parameters that changed during the flight (compare with initial values)

Please execute this entire inspection mission step by step, confirming each action before moving to the next. Warn me immediately if any step fails or if battery gets critically low.

- ✅ `get_parameter` - Check RTL_ALT and battery capacity
- ✅ `set_parameter` - Modify RTL altitude if needed

### Advanced Navigation (v1.2.0)

## Common Issues & Solutions

**GPS coordinates drift:**
- Adjust lat/lon for your test location
- Use relative coordinates from current position

**Navigation issues:**
- Check GPS lock is good (3D fix with 6+ satellites)
- Error message provides waypoint-based workaround

**Mission upload format errors:**
- Ensure exact field names: `latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`, `relative_altitude_m`
- Each waypoint must be a dictionary with all three fields

**Mission download fails:**
- Some autopilots don't support download
- Keep local copy of uploaded missions

**Battery showing 0%:**
- Likely uncalibrated sensor or simulator limitation
- Check voltage instead (should be > 10V)
- Set `BATT_CAPACITY` parameter
