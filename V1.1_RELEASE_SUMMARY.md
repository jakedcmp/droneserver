## 💬 ChatGPT Natural Language Examples

### Safety First
```
"Before we fly, run a health check and tell me the battery level"
"How many GPS satellites do we have?"
"If anything goes wrong, return to launch immediately"
"Hold position! I need to check something"
"Check battery - if it's below 30%, land now"
```

### Flight Operations
```
"Take off to 20 meters, check battery, then fly north 100 meters"
"Go to latitude 33.645, longitude -117.842 at 50 meters altitude"
"Set max speed to 8 m/s for safety"
"Fly a survey pattern, checking battery after each leg"
```

### Mission Management
```
"Start the mission, but pause every 5 waypoints for battery check"
"If battery drops below 25%, pause mission and return home"
"Clear the old mission and upload this new one"
```

### Complete Flight Scenario
```
User: "Let's fly a complete mission"

ChatGPT can now:
1. "Run health check" (get_health)
2. "Check battery level" (get_battery)
3. "How many GPS satellites?" (get_gps_info)
4. "Arm the drone" (arm_drone)
5. "Takeoff to 15 meters" (takeoff)
6. "Set max speed to 10 m/s" (set_max_speed)
7. "Fly north 50 meters" (move_to_relative)
8. "What's our speed?" (get_speed)
9. "Check battery again" (get_battery)
10. "Return to launch" (return_to_launch)
11. "Disarm when landed" (disarm_drone)

ALL OF THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN v1.0.0!
```
